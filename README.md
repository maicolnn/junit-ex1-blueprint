## Start Developing your Project

### Set up your project on GitHub  

To continuously build and deploy your application, we recommend using GitHub as described [here](README-GitHub.md).

### Package Structure
To organize our code we recommend the following package structure:

``` 
(com.github.junit-test-sample-01)
    plugins
    |    <technology 1>
    |    ...
    |    <technology n>
    dto  
    |    <use case 1>
    |    ...
    |    <use case n>
    junit-test-sample-01.java
```

### Cleanup Readme

After successfully set up your new project, you should clean up the text of README as described [here](https://www.makeareadme.com)
